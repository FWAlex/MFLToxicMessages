Being abused confuses a child’s conceptions about sexuality and sexual behaviour and morality. It also occurs when very frightening memories and events become associated in the child’s mind with sexual activity.

Behaviours associated with this effect:

- Not honouring your body
- Shutting your body down
- Not Knowing what you feel

These behaviours may be familiar as something you're experiencing now, or you experience in your past. As you read through the list, select which behaviours apply to your experience.

Recognising behaviours  in this way can be a step towards recognising the effects  of trauma on us  and potentially reducing them.
